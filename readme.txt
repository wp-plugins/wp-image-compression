== Description ==

WP Image Compression is a quick and easy way to not only resize your images.  We have integrated Imsanity (https://wordpress.org/plugins/imsanity/) which allows for automated resizing of your site wide images, initially saving storage space.

We have also added image compression through the awesome PNG Quant (http://pngquant.org/) which will generate on average 65-80% compression with little to no loss of quality across your images.

First 200MB per month is free for all users, Compression packages start from only ï¿½3.00 per month (http://www.wpimage.co.uk/compresion-plans/) which covers you upto 1GB per month.

Is this secure:
Yes, we use SSL layers on every aspect on our dashboard system, and the plugin creates a new hashcode to talk to the dashboard on each activation.  Your admin password is never exposed or shared with any of our systems.
